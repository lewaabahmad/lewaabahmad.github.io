<p>
  My name is Lewaa Bahmad and I am a DJ and music producer who champions and facilitates full self-expression through music, dance, and community. As the ultimate dance commander, I am on a sacred mission of sonic dope peddling. I do this because I believe every person on my dancefloor is a hero - my sets are mythic soundtracks to their journeys calling them to discover and revel in their own glory.
</p>
<p>
  At the end of my sets, my dancers stand proud with crowns of gold sweat adorning their brows. Their triumph is the reclamation of rightful thrones in their own center of the universe. Looking around, they recognize their peers - a pantheon of gods.
