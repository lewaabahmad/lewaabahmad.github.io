<p class="lead mb-3">
  My name is Lewaa Bahmad and I am a Software Engineer committed to creating web experiences that are user-friendly and delightfully
  intuitive. I believe in being quick to market, functional deliverables, and user-led iterative improvements.
</p>
<p class="lead mb-3">
  A significant portion of my career has been anchored around the Ruby on Rails framework and its ecosystem,
  allowing me to deeply appreciate and master its capabilities. I am lethal across the stack and capable of rapid
  product development. 
</p>
<p class="lead mb-3">
  While I am most proficient in HTML, Ruby, SQL, and JavaScript I have always adopted new
  technologies with gusto. My strength lies in understanding complex business needs and translating them into
  effective, practical tech solutions. I value clarity, efficiency, and robustness in every codebase I contribute
  to.
</p>
<p class="lead mb-3">
  I currently reside in Chattanooga, TN, but my professional collaborations have spanned across various
  geographical boundaries. I am currently open to both remote opportunities and roles that involve some travel.
